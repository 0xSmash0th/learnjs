# getting started with node.

Node.js is server-side javascript. It is well-suited to real-time applications and systems that are heavy on input and output. You can use it to create web servers, to manage information in databases, to build real-time communication tools, and more.

## In this book, we'll use node in these ways:
- Install command line tools available through node's package manager, `npm`.
- Create basic web servers to serve static content to our web browser.
- Experiment with real-time, multi-user applications.

## To learn node in detail, read these resources in this order:
- [art of node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node)
- [streams handbook](https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook)
