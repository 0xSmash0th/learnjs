# Chapter Three

## A fanpage for pizza.

We're going to make a website for pizza as our first project and host it using GitHub Pages. I'm pretty excited about that. This project starts out a little heavy on html and css, but that's alright for the first project isn't it? Maybe you need an html/css refresher. If you're a hero of markup and styling you should be able to complete this project super fast, or you may want to ski(m/p) this chapter.

### A breakdown of what we'll go over:  
- Sketching the contents of the page.  
- Brief overview of html and css.  
- Using an online editor.  
- Adding text and images.
- Creating a pizza with code.
- Getting photos of pizza from the instagram api.
- Using menu data from your favorite pizza place, aka: using json.
- A map of your favorite pizza places.

### Sketching the contents of the page.
We're making a fanpage about pizza. A microsite. If this were the 1990s we'd be making a zine with paper, scissors, and secretly using a copy machine for free.

**This is not the 1990s.**

But we can build our pizza microsite with a similar tone and purpose. On the web everyone is a publisher, so let's publish something awesome about pizza. 

Choosing pizza as the topic is arbitrary. You could make a fanpage for anything. 

If we were writing a zine in the '90s we might make a quick prototype with a pencil. And you know, that's basically what we'll do right now, too. Instead of calling it a zine, we'll call it a microsite.

Get a pencil and a piece of paper. Or find a marker and go to your window or whiteboard. Whatever. Let's sketch.

#### We'll start by drawing four things:
1. the header
2. the main content area.
3. a large pizza in the main area.
4. the footer.
 
##### The header.
The header will be very simple, just the title, description, and a cool little pizza icon.

##### The main content area.
The main content area will have a few things:

- A large pizza.
- A list of your favorite types of pizza.
- A map of your favorite pizza places.

##### The footer.
The footer of this microsite will be very simple. Think of it like the credits of a movie or masthead of a newspaper. Any small details that people need to know.
Things like:
- Who you are
- How the site was made
- Licensing of the code and content
- Contact information

### Create the project file/directory structure:

#### Create the index.html, app.js, and style.css files:

~~~~~~~~
touch index.html app.js style.css
~~~~~~~~

#### Create a folder for images:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir images
~~~~~~~~

#### Add the following markup to your index.html file:

(you don't have to copy the comments)

~~~~~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

<!-- the title of the page â€“ shows up in the browser tab/window -->
<title>I love pizza.</title>

<!-- this ensures ie is using the latest rendering mode -->
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

<!-- default viewport settings to help with mobile/responsive design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<!-- include our css styles -->
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">

</head>

<body>
  <h1>I love pizza.</h1>

  <!-- include our javascript -->
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
~~~~~~~~

That'll get us started.

### Adding text and images to our microsite.

#### Add the header:

Replace the current `h1` tag with this markup for the header:

~~~~~~~~
<header>
  <h1>I love pizza</h1>
</header>
~~~~~~~~

After the closing header tag, add this main content section:

~~~~~~~~
<main role="main">
  <p>Pizza is my favorite food in the world, and here's why: it's delicious.</p>
</main>
~~~~~~~~

The `main` tag is a fairly new addition to html5. Feel free to use your own text about pizza here.

After the closing body tag, add a footer:

~~~~~~~~
<footer>
  <p>Made by YOUR NAME HERE with love for pizza.</p>
</footer>
~~~~~~~~

That should give us an html document that looks like this:

~~~~~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>

<title>I love pizza.</title>
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">

</head>

<body>

<header>
  <h1>I love pizza</h1>
</header>

<main role="main">
  <p>Pizza is my favorite food in the world, and here's why: it's delicious.</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>Made by YOUR NAME HERE with love for pizza.</p>
</footer>

<script src="app.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
~~~~~~~~

### Give the page some very simple styles
Add this to the style.css file:

~~~~~~~~
html,
body {
  font: 16px/1.3 "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
  color: #444;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-weight: 300;
}

a {
  color: #3c80c3;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active,
a:focus {
  color: #1e4062;
}

img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

/* mobile size */
.container {
  width: 80%;
  padding: 0px 10%;
  margin: 0px auto;
}

/* tablet size */
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {
  .container {
    width: 540px;
    padding: 0px 20px;
  }
}

/* desktop size */
@media only screen and (min-width: 960px) {
  .container {
    width: 800px;
  }
}
~~~~~~~~
