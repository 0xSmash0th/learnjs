# Chapter Three

## A fanpage for pizza.

We're going to make a website for pizza as our first project and host it using GitHub Pages. I'm pretty excited about that. This project starts out a little heavy on html and css, but that's alright for the first project isn't it? Maybe you need an html/css refresher. If you're a hero of markup and styling you should be able to complete this project super fast, or you may want to ski(m/p) this chapter.

### A breakdown of what we'll go over:  
- Sketching the contents of the page.  
- Brief overview of html and css.  
- Using an online editor.  
- Adding text and images.
- Creating a pizza with code.
- Getting photos of pizza from the instagram api.
- Using menu data from your favorite pizza place, aka: using json.
- A map of your favorite pizza places.

### Sketching the contents of the page.
We're making a fanpage about pizza. A microsite. If this were the 1990s we'd be making a zine with paper, scissors, and secretly using a copy machine for free.

**This is not the 1990s.**

But we can build our pizza microsite with a similar tone and purpose. On the web everyone is a publisher, so let's publish something awesome about pizza. 

Choosing pizza as the topic is arbitrary. You could make a fanpage for anything. 

If we were writing a zine in the '90s we might make a quick prototype with a pencial. And you know, that's basically what we'll do right now, too. Instead of calling it a zine, we'll call it a microsite.

Get a pencil and a piece of paper. Or find a marker and go to your window or whiteboard. Whatever. Let's sketch.

#### We'll start by drawing four things:
1. the header
2. the main content area.
3. a large pizza in the main area.
4. the footer.
 
##### The header.
The header will be very simple, just the title, description, and a cool little pizza icon.

##### The main content area.
The main content area will have a few things:

- A large pizza.
- A list of your favorite types of pizza.
- A map of your favorite pizza places.

##### The footer.
The footer of this microsite will be very simple. Think of it like the credits of a movie or masthead of a newspaper. Any small details that people need to know.
Things like:
- Who you are
- How the site was made
- Licensing of the code and content
- Contact information

### Overview of html & css.

### Using online text editors.

### Adding text and images to our microsite.

### Creating a pizza with code.
We're going to use a javascript library called raphael.js


### Adding menu data using json.
Let's say you're favorite pizza place is named Pizza Pi, and one of the employees is also a web developer. This awesome pizza artist decided to create a json feed of their menu, so customers can work with the data. Weird, right?


### Map your favorite pizza places.
