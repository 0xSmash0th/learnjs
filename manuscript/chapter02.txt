## create a minecraft-like world in your browser with voxel.js

voxel.js is a game engine for creating 3d voxel worlds with javascript. It's like minecraft, but open-source. Over {somenum} people have already contributed to the project.

One cool thing about voxel.js is that it isn't just one big library â€“ there's a main game engine, [voxel-engine](http://github.com/maxogden/voxel-engine), and a bunch of [modules that extend the functionality of the engine](http://voxeljs.com/#modules). Quite a few people have created modules for voxel.js, and in this chapter we'll both make a game using voxel.js, and create a module that modifies the gameplay in a new way.

Create a package.json file with these contents:
~~~~~~~~
{
  "name": "mygamename",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "beefy game.js:bundle.js --live"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "voxel-hello-world": "0.6.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "beefy": "*"
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Install the dependencies:

~~~~~~~~
npm install
~~~~~~~~

Create a game.js file, and start it out with this code:

~~~~~~~~
var createGame = require('voxel-hello-world')
var game = createGame()
~~~~~~~~

Here we're requiring the `voxel-hello-world` module, and creating our game with the `createGame()` function.
