### How to use this book
You should complete the first few chapters in order. Initially, you'll learn js basics and how to use development tools. Next, you should work on the projects that interest you most.

This book is under active development and will see ongoing updates. Learning to build a project with a specific javascript library is only useful for as long as that library is supported and the best solution to the problem. The tools we use for web development change regularly, so this book will morph along with the javascript development standards of the day.
