# Introduction to git & GitHub

Developing web sites and applications without using git is equivalent to writing in Microsoft Word without ever saving your work.

**Use git.**

Git is a version control system, which means that it can track every change you make to your code. This allows you to go back in versions if you mess something up, or figure out when errors were introduced to the code.

There are many other bonuses to using git, much of which is out of scope for this book.

The best way to get started learning git (and GitHub) is to visit [try.github.com](http://try.github.com).

## Get on GitHub
If you haven't already, create an account at [github.com](http://github.com).

GitHub is a great place to host your code. Many employers hiring for developer and designer positions will ask for a GitHub profile, and use your activity there as part of the criteria in their decision-making process.

In fact, if you're looking to get a job with a particular company, try to find _their_ GitHub profile and start contributing to their open source projects. This will help you stand out â€“ they'll already know your technical abilities based on your open source contributions. That's a big win.

Anyway, GitHub is super useful for collaborating on projects with people, and for most open source communities has become the de facto code hosting service.

## Create a site for yourself using GitHub

GitHub has a useful service called [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) that allows you to host a simple site on their servers for free.

### With GitHub Pages you can:
- design it any way you want by having complete control over the html, css, and javascript.
- use simple templates that are available for getting started using GitHub Pages.
- create sites for yourself and all of your projects hosted on GitHub.
- use a custom domain name if you want!

Visit the [help section for GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) to learn about it in detail.
