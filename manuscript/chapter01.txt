# Chapter 1

## Make a simple game

Let's build a game, everybody. Let's have some fun.

Our game will be built from scratch.

We'll create a bunch of objects and functions. We'll put them together to make our game run, and experiment with changing the functions and the object attributes to alter the behavior of the game.

It'll be a single player game. A [roguelike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) [rpg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game) with extremely simple graphics.

Usually roguelike games have procedurally generated levels, but we'll just build static levels for this example.

Our game will feature monsters, weapons, coins, potions, and a hero.

That small list above gives us a good sense of what objects and functions we'll need in our code.

We'll need to represent each of those things in our game code, so let's briefly outline the parts of the game we'll need to build, along with the typical actions each part will have:

### Game
- Loop
- Draw

### Level
- Load level data
- Draw

### Hero
- Update
- Draw
- Drink Potion
- Pick up Coin
- Fight Monster

### Monster
- Update
- Draw
- Fight Hero

### Weapon
- Update
- Draw

### Coin
- Update
- Draw

### Potions
- Update
- Draw

Each of the above headers will be an object in our game, and each of the list items will be methods or attributes of their respective headers.

## Requirements:
You'll need these things installed on your computer:
- node.js
- browserify and beefy

To get started, create a folder for your game. I'm calling it `node-rogue`:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir node-rogue
cd node-rogue
~~~~~~~~

Run the npm init command to create a package.json file for your project:

~~~~~~~~
npm init
~~~~~~~~

Answer all the questions however you want. I kept them mostly at the defaults (text in parentheses is the default, if you just hit enter it'll use that default value).

~~~~~~~~
name: (node-rogue) 
version: (0.0.0) 
description: a roguelike game made with javascript
entry point: (index.js) game.js
test command: node test.js
git repository: git://github.com/learn-js/node-rogue
keywords: gamezzz
author: seth vincent
license: (BSD) MIT

You should end up with a package.json file that looks like this:

~~~~~~~~
{
  "name": "node-rogue",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "a roguelike game made with javascript",
  "main": "game.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node test.js"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git://github.com/learnjs/node-rogue"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "gamezzz"
  ],
  "author": "sethvincent",
  "license": "MIT",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/learnjs/node-rogue/issues"
  }
}
~~~~~~~~

Now, create the game.js and test.js files:

~~~~~~~~
touch game.js test.js
~~~~~~~~

We'll also need an index.html file:

~~~~~~~~
touch index.html
~~~~~~~~

Open up that file and make it look like this:

~~~~~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>node-rogue</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="title">node-rogue</h1>

<canvas id="game"></canvas>

<script src="./bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
~~~~~~~~

Let's add a css file:

~~~~~~~~
touch style.css
~~~~~~~~

And give it some very basic styles:

~~~~~~~~
html,
body {
  font: 16px/1.2 "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;
  color: #444;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-smoothing: antialiased;
  font-weight: 300;
}

h1#title {
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}

canvas#game {
  display: block;
  margin: 0px auto;
}
~~~~~~~~
