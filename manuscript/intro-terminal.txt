# Introduction to the terminal

Get excited, it's time to use the terminal.


## Mac / Linux

For most purpose, daily activity in the terminal will be the same in Mac and various Linux distros.

Basic commands include:

Changing directory:

~~~~~~~~
cd path/of/directories
~~~~~~~~

`cd` on its own, or `cd ~` will take you to your home directory.

Create a directory:

~~~~~~~~
mkdir directory-name
~~~~~~~~

Show the directory you're currently in:

~~~~~~~~
pwd
~~~~~~~~

List the files in the directory:

~~~~~~~~
ls
~~~~~~~~

List the files in a more readable way, with useful information like permissions included:

~~~~~~~~
ls -al
~~~~~~~~

Open a file with its default application:

~~~~~~~~
open filename
~~~~~~~~

Open current directory in the finder:

~~~~~~~~
open .
~~~~~~~~

or open some other directory:

~~~~~~~~
open path/to/directory
~~~~~~~~

Create an empty file if it doesn't already exist:

~~~~~~~~
touch file-name
~~~~~~~~

Open and edit a file with the simple nano editor:

~~~~~~~~
nano file-name
~~~~~~~~

Delete a file:

~~~~~~~~
rm file-name
~~~~~~~~

Delete a directory and its contents:

~~~~~~~~
rm -rf path/to/directory
~~~~~~~~

Never do this:

~~~~~~~~
rm -rf /
~~~~~~~~

Be very careful with the rm command. You can delete things on accident very easily.

Clear the terminal screen of previous activity:

~~~~~~~~
clear
~~~~~~~~

Reset the terminal:

~~~~~~~~
reset
~~~~~~~~





## Windows
